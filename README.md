# Simple Todo App

Thisa project is a simple todo app, it allows you to make a todo list, though not fully indept but enough to make an idea and plan ahead.

## Functionality

This a simple todo app, allows you add/schedule things or what you wish todo. You are also able to delete it as well. Once completed you are able to click the check mark button. It keeps count of todos, what you have completed and the total all together.

## Technology

The use of imports across the ajavascript files to import them into the index.js to not repeat functions or place into a single file.
Used OOP principals on the FormValidator.js to create the unqiue ids.
Destructuring of syntax as well.
